This repository contains the beginnings of an attempted port of the original public domain C++ implementation by the main author of the paper Francisco Martínez.   

The original code can be found in the reference folder.  
  
The plan is to implement a performant port, add additional tests and some method by which to generate renders of output clipping operations.   
  
This is currently an intellectual exercise but I believe a C# port could be very useful in many applications if proven successful. 
  
All and any assistance is gratefully accepted. :heart:
